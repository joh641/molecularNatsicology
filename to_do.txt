possible

- popular rules
- prerequisites
- user information (GPA, transcripts)
- when a course is offered

functionality
- autopopulate plans from user information (major, years of semester)
- ability to add more semesters
- ability to clear board/semester
- selecting which rules you want
- UI for editing rules/yaml
- all query matching across period (allow spaces in queries)
- handling more than one major
- able to flag a course under a certain rule
- handling variable unit courses

appearance

- take out bootstrap
- ability to move courses within a semester around
- in results, adding a checkmark shifts everything a bit
- course info, pull more
  - edit drag/drop library for click vs drag http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1771627/preventing-click-event-with-jquery-drag-and-drop
- landing page
- semesters smaller to fit on one page
- handling semester box expansion
- sizing glitches drag and drop
- make ui more responsive
- maybe make clear semester opaque then less opaque when hover

chores

- going through completed rules, make sure they work
- shorten names of rules
- mapping of names/rename departments
- sort courses by name and number, course letter (after doing so, remove initial sort in js)
  - more efficient -> place garbage course in right place instead of sorting everything
- separate courses and plans controller again (combined for sake of duplicate removal)
- updating rule (can only use up to 2 from same dept for breadths)

brainstorm

- checking multipart rules(ones that can't be satisfied just seeing numcourses/numunits, ex. a major)
  - rule passes if meets num_courses, num_units + all sub_rules pass

- remove course if used for rule and can only be used once
  - all different combinations to decide which one to remove/use for a certain rule
    - utility function of numRulesSatisfied, proportion of courses left to fulfill other requirements
  - flag as an exclusive rule, which removes course from plan when checking rest
