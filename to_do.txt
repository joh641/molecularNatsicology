In Progress
- remove course if used for rule and can only be used once
  - all different combinations to decide which one to remove/use for a certain rule
    - utility function of numRulesSatisfied, proportion of courses left to fulfill other requirements
  - flag as an exclusive rule, which removes course from plan when checking rest
- scrolling highlights of site
  - fast
  - easy to use
  - all your courses are here
  - discover courses you'll love
  - a schedule that's personal
  - courses bring us together
  - want the right schedule? just browse
  - degree auditing in an instant
- make ui more responsive, mobile friendly
  - mobile options
    - drop down of semester to add course to
    - slider to switch between semestesrs (where backpack is)
    - moving courses around?
    - in course modal, show which requirements satisfies, drop down to add to a semesters

  
Next Tasks
- filter by course name first, then by title
- semester object should have year+fa/sp/su
- save dept name as field
- tag line
- selecting which rules you want
- switch plans without reload
- editing of course info in ui
- display rule description in modal, plus courses that satisfy
- sort courses beforehand in rails
  - more efficient -> place garbage course in right place instead of sorting everything

Functionality
- autopopulate plans from user information (major, years of semester)
- query partial matches across spaces
- updating rule (can only use up to 2 from same dept for breadths)

Appearance
- ability to hide a year
- color code (breadth, major, university)
- show remaining requirements unsatisfied in course catalog, click to display 
  courses that satisfy, show course that will fulfill multiple requirements
- site tour
- handling display of plan names that are long
- ability to move courses within a semester around
- more modal styling

Chores
- going through completed rules, make sure they work
- online/summer versions of classes should also work with rules
- documentation
- tag rules by major

After First Release
- able to flag a course under a certain rule
- UI for editing rules/yaml
- ability to add more semesters
- handling more than one major
- handling variable unit courses
- labeling pnp courses
- make front-end checking more efficient 
  - fail fast
  - check subrules at same time as main rule

Possible Features
- popular rules
- prerequisites
- user information (GPA, transcripts)
- when a course is offered
- ninjacourses/courserank semesterly calendar
- allow input of grades, display gpa overall/per semester
- share plan
- sample major plan
- different gradients for semesters
- user picks color of classes, heavier load can tell by color (based on #units, diff reqs, etc)

Optional Tasks
- about us page
- maybe don't use .concat?
- loading bars/progress wheel
- alphabetically sort course when swapping between query list and ones already in plan
- in results, adding a checkmark shifts everything a bit
- shorten names of rules
- more consistent json object attribute accessing [] vs .
- separate courses and plans controller again (combined for sake of duplicate removal)
- colors for flash messages
- delete courses
-structure
  - move all requires
