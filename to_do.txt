- remove course if used for rule and can only be used once
- rename departments
- UI for editing rules/yaml

drag and drop
- shouldn't allow duplicates
- should garbage be watched? only benefit is if you drags straight from course list to garbage
- if you put more courses than room in div, just overflows
