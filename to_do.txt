- handling more than one major

appearance

- in results, adding a checkmark shifts everything a bit
- landing page
- make ui more responsive

chores

- going through completed rules, make sure they work
- shorten names of rules
- mapping of names/rename departments

brainstorm

- checking multipart rules(ones that can't be satisfied just seeing numcourses/numunits, ex. a major)
  - rule passes if meets num_courses, num_units + all sub_rules pass

- shouldn't allow duplicates
- putting in garbage loses from list of courses unless you refresh
  - when loading a plan, remove courses already in from total list of courses (avoid duplicates)
  - when putting something in garbage, push that course back into courses

- remove course if used for rule and can only be used once
  - all different combinations to decide which one to remove/use for a certain rule
  - flag as an exclusive rule, which removes course from plan when checking rest
